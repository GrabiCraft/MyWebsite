    <h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Matthias and I am currently 14 years old. This are my first real steps in html and javascript. Although there is no real JS content here yet,
        I will add it as soon as I learn how to do it correctly. The Window alert and my "what am I doing" message was already programmed in JS.
